- 💅 **Beautiful design** powered by **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive UI
- 🔧 **TypeScript integration** ensures type safety and robust code
- 🧩 **Clean code structure** with separated logic for better maintainability and scalability
- 📜 **JSDoc documentation** for almost all functions, making the code easy to understand and extend
- 🎯 Focused on **developer experience** to facilitate easy onboarding and contributions

## Technologies Used 🛠️
